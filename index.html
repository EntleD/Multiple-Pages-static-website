      A chocolate croissant, also known as a pain au chocolat, is a traditional
      French pastry made from layers of buttery, flaky croissant dough filled
      with chocolate. The dough is made from a combination of flour, yeast,
      sugar, and butter, and is folded and rolled multiple times to create
      layers of butter and dough. The chocolate filling is typically made from
      high-quality chocolate, such as bittersweet or dark chocolate, and is
      added to the dough before it is shaped and baked.
